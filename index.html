                    <h2>Landscape Install</h2>
                    <p>Our landscape install service transforms your outdoor spaces into functional and aesthetically
                        pleasing environments. It begins with sod cutting to remove grass from designated bed areas,
                        followed by adding soil amendments to enhance the quality of the soil for optimal plant growth.
                        We then plant flowers, shrubs, or other greenery tailored to your design preferences. To 
                        complete the installation, we add a top layer of mulch or decorative stone, for visual
                        appeal.

                    <h2>Mulching</h2>
                    <p>Our mulching service focuses on maintaining the health and appearance of your garden beds.
                        In the spring, we clean up any debris or deteriorated mulch from the previous season and apply
                        a fresh two inch layer of mulch to enrich the soil and improve curb appeal. In the fall, we lightly
                        dust over the existing mulch to refresh its look and ensure continued protection for the soil
                        through the colder months. Leaf cleanup service ensures your property remains neat and free 
                        of debris throughout the year.
